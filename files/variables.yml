# Peon value format: (dictionary)
#   name: Required, partial identifier for VM (combined with adept_identifier)
#   defaults: Optional, retrieved values from peon_defaults w/ this key
#   version: Optional, arbitrary version / type string for image mapping
#   groups: Optional, list of ansible-group lists to join.
#           One dynamic group, '{{adept_job}}' will always be added.
#   private: # Use private / security mode when True
#   volume: # Optional, if non-empty, size (GB) of additional storage attach

# These values will be used as defaults in place of any required/missing
# values for each peon below.  The item name must match the value from
